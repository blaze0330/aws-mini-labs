In the [last lesson/lab ](lesson1-ec2-with-terraform.MD), we launched a basic EC2 instance with terraform. 
In this lab, we will launch linux EC2 instance and ssh, and then launch a windows EC2 instane and RDP into it. Please go to  [last lesson/lab ](lesson1-ec2-with-terraform.MD) if you haven't gone throught it . We introduce terraform in that lesosn. 



## Steps: 

1) Go to your AWS Management Console , navigate to the EC2 dashboard, click on Key Pairs. Click Create Key Pair. Enter a name like terraform-key and click create. 
![key](../images/key-pair.png)
![key](../images/Create-key-start.png)
![key](../images/Create-key.png)

This will download a file to your computers default downloads folder. 

2) On the EC2 Dashboard , click launch instance,  and find a Windows 2012( or any windows AMI)  AMI on your selected region. Note down the AMI id. On us-east-1 region I chose Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base - **ami-066663db63b3aa675**
2) Create a new folder, copy the downloaded key file to this folder. In the same folder create a text file with a name like windows.tf and paste this code. Note this is very similar to last lessons code. Replace the ami-id if you're in a different region.
```HCL
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "ACCESS_KEY_HERE"
  secret_key = "SECRET_KEY_HERE"
  region     = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-066663db63b3aa675"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name = "terraform-key"
  security_groups = ["${aws_security_group.allow_rdp.name}"]

}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_rdp" {
  name        = "allow_rdp"
  description = "Allow rdp traffic"


  ingress {

    from_port   = 3389 #  By default, the windows server listens on TCP port 3389 for RDP
    to_port     = 3389
    protocol =   "tcp"

    cidr_blocks =  ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

3) After you create the windows.tf file. Save it .Make sure you have AWS your Credentials entered properly.  Then use this command to launch the terraform stack 
```
terraform apply --auto-approve 
```

Auto approve flag skips the yes/no question whether if you want to create the stack or not. 

4) Go to your AWS Management Console. An EC2 should be spinning up. Wait 5 minutes( Windows instaces take around 5 mins to get ready) . Then select the EC2 Instance and click on connect. 
- Click Decrypt passoword. 
- Choose your .pem file you downloaded earlier and upload it to decrypt the password
- Once you get the password , download the RDP file
- Open the downloaded RDP file. You will be asked for the pasword when Windows Remote desktop opens. Supply the pass. Note: If you don't have Remote Desktop Installed, you many need to install it.

![key](../images/windows.png)

5) You should be logged in now. 

6) Let's destroy the AWS resources with the following command
```
terraform destroy
```









## New Concepts introduced
- How to create Security Groups 
- resource dependency. We refer to the SG with **aws_security_group.example.id**
